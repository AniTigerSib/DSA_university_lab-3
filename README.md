## Base searching algorythms
Task:
1. Develop 3 functions, that realizes following search algorythms:
    - "Jump" search (single-level and two-level)
    - Binary search
    - Interpolation search
2. Explore searching algorythms: compare the dependencies of the average number of comparisons in cases of successful and unsuccessful search for given algorithms
3. Find dependence of the optimal "jump" lenght on the size of sequence
